# 🪝 HooksApp

A modern React project built as part of sections 9–12 of the [React: De cero a experto ( Hooks y MERN )](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-cero-experto) course by **Fernando Herrera**.

This app explores advanced concepts in React, including state management, React hooks, transitions, async APIs, validation, and routing — all developed using **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, and **ShadCN/UI** for styling.

## 🚀 Features & Hooks Used

* 🔁 **useState** – Manage local state across components
* 🔄 **useEffect** – Handle side effects and transitions
* 🧠 **Custom Hooks** – e.g., `useTrafficLight` to abstract reusable logic
* 🧾 **useRef** – Persist values across renders without re-rendering
* ⚙️ **useReducer** – Complex state logic (e.g. word game, reducer pattern)
* 💾 **LocalStorage Integration** – Persistent state with reducer
* ✅ **Zod Validation** – Form and data validation with schema enforcement
* 🧩 **useMemo** – Performance optimization with memoized values
* ✨ **useOptimistic** – Optimistic UI updates
* ⏳ **useTransition & Suspense** – Handle UI loading states gracefully
* 🌐 **React Router (Data APIs)** – Advanced routing with data loading
* 📦 **Context API** – Shared state management (e.g., user session)
* 🔐 **Private Routes** – Conditional rendering based on auth context

## 🧩 UI & Libraries

* 🎨 **TailwindCSS** – Utility-first CSS framework
* 🧱 **Shadcn/UI** – Prebuilt, accessible component library
* 🔔 **Sonner** – Toast notifications
* ✅ **Zod** – Runtime schema validation for forms and APIs
